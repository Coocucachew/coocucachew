## Tech stack

On the back end, Express was used to handle server calls, and PostgreSQL to store our Customers information, currently cart and order history. On the front end, we used React/Redux to keep UI and state in sync, and local storage for Guest's cart. We also used Travis for continuous integration and Chai/Mocha for tests.
